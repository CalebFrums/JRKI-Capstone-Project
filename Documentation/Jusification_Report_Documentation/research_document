ARIMA

ARIMA models are a longstanding staple in economic and unemployment forecasting, prized for their ability to handle non-stationary trends and short-term dynamics. For instance:

Tang et al. (2005) demonstrated that ARIMA can effectively capture short-term trends in unemployment data, making it a useful tool for policymakers. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics also employs ARIMA models for short-term unemployment forecasting.

Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) models have been shown to significantly outperform naive benchmarks in U.S. unemployment rate forecasting across various horizons:

Seasonal ARIMA and transfer-function models significantly outperform a no-change (random walk) benchmark, particularly during economic downturns.

Random Forest

Random Forest models are powerful in capturing nonlinear effects and complex interactions among predictors—especially useful in macroeconomic forecasting contexts.

Random Forests can accurately capture nonlinear links and interaction effects between predictors—such as oil-price uncertainty and other macro/financial variables—when forecasting the UK unemployment rate over 150 years of monthly data.

In macroeconomic applications, a specialized version (Macroeconomic Random Forest) even outperforms linear models in forecasting unemployment:

The Macroeconomic Random Forest (MRF) delivers clear forecast gains in predicting the 2008 rise in unemployment and allows interpretable, time-varying parameter estimation.

Gradient Boosting / ML Ensembling

Ensemble ML models—including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and others—are widely applied to unemployment forecasting with increases in accuracy over traditional methods:

A supervised ML study compared SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extreme Learning Machine in state-level unemployment rate prediction, utilizing these for improved accuracy.

Recent research compared ML methods directly on monthly U.S. unemployment data:

A 2025 study evaluated Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and others against standard regression models to produce timely unemployment forecasts.
