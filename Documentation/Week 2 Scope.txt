🎯 Next Week Realistic Scope (Week 2)

  📋 Requirements Match Analysis:

  ✅ Already Completed (Week 1):

- Initial data assessment ✅
- Data quality issue documentation ✅
- Basic cleaning procedures ✅
- Data exploration with 5 government CSV files ✅

  📈 Week 2 Priority Tasks:

  1. Complete ML Model Preparation (Requirement 5.1-5.3)

- Feature Engineering: Create lag features, moving averages, trend indicators
- Data Splitting: Temporal train/validation/test splits maintaining chronological order
- Multi-Algorithm Prep: Format data for ARIMA, LSTM, ensemble methods

  2. Demographic Analysis Enhancement (Requirement 4.2)

  "Do you want to compare different demographics? Yes, it will be very helpful"

- Expand demographic processing beyond age groups
- Sex-based breakdowns (Male/Female/Total)
- Regional demographic comparisons (your current 3-region foundation)

  3. Economic Factors Integration (Requirement 4.3)

  "The factors are interconnected"

- Integrate CPI, GDP, LCI data with unemployment (you've already cleaned these!)
- Create correlation analysis between economic indicators
- Prepare interconnected factor analysis structure

  4. Model Training & Validation (Week 7 Requirement)

- ARIMA models for Auckland, Wellington, Canterbury
- Basic LSTM implementation
- Simple ensemble approach (Random Forest)
- Out-of-time validation testing

  🚨 Realistic Constraints:

  What NOT to Attempt:

- ❌ All 18 regional councils (stick to your 3-region foundation)
- ❌ Live dashboard integration (that's later weeks)
- ❌ Full 10 CSV file processing (maintain your 5-file focus)
- ❌ Professional-grade security protocols

  What IS Achievable:

- ✅ Expand from 5 to 6-7 CSV files
- ✅ Build first forecasting models with cleaned data
- ✅ Create demographic comparison capability
- ✅ Integrate economic indicators as predictors
- ✅ Basic model evaluation and validation

  📊 Week 2 Daily Breakdown:

  Monday-Tuesday: Feature engineering and data splitting
  Wednesday-Thursday: First ARIMA models for 3 regionsFriday-Saturday: LSTM experimentation and ensemble methods
  Sunday: Model evaluation and comparison

  Expected Output: Working forecasting models using your cleaned data with demographic and economic factor integration.

  This builds naturally on your Week 1 foundation while meeting the actual requirements for model preparation and demographic analysis.
